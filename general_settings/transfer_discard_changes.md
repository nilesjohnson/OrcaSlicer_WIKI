# Transfer or Discard Changes popup dialog

This window appears when switching away from a preset profile that has unsaved changes.
There are options to discard, transfer, or save settings.
These options apply to *preset profile* settings, separately from any settings saved in a project 3mf file.

The options are:

- **Discard**: Switch to the new profile, discarding any changes.
- **Transfer**: All *New Value* settings will be applied into the new profile, but not saved as changes in that profile.
- **Save**: All *New Value* settings are saved in the previous profile.

A similar dialog pops up when you close OrcaSlicer with unsaved changes. In that case, the Discard and Save buttons have the same function, and there is no Transfer button.

Note: None of these buttons save the current 3mf file; that must be done separately.
